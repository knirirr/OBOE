<h1>Welcome to OBOE</h1>

<p>The acronym for this service is derived from the phrase <b>Oxford Batch Operation Engine</b>. Its purpose is to run analyses that might normally be performed by a self-contained command-line application and to make them available via the web. It is currently under heavy development so this page may change (including the name).

<p>Services include: 

<ul>
  <li>The <%= link_to 'Local Ecological Footprint Tool', :controller => 'info', :action => 'welcome_left' -%> &mdash; a prototype service is now live.
  <li>A <a href="http://vbrant.eu">ViBRANT</a>-funded job-processing backend for <a href="http://scratchpads.eu">Scratchpads</a> &mdash; awaiting services.
  <li>Various other services to be added later.
</ul>

<p>This site is currently open to anyone who <%= link_to "registers", :controller => 'devise/registrations', :action => 'new' -%>, but as development progresses then specific analyses will be developed for specific users. More information will appear on this page as we continue to work on the site.

<p>If you have an account then you may view your jobs <%= link_to "here", jobs_path -%>.
